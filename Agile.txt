The aspects that diffrenciate waterfall and agile:
1. Requirements- frequently changes
2. Documentation - more in person communication rather than doc
3. Deliverables - release deliverables in stages instead a grand event


Agile Manifesto:
1. Individuals and interaction over process and tools.
2. Wotking software over comperhesive documentation.
3. customer collobrations over contract negotations.
4. responding to change over following a plan.
