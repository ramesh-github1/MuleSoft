Big-O: tells the efficiency of the code. Technically, it always tell the worst case.
Time complexity: it is not the time it consider for the execution, rather it the number of operations.
Space complexity


O(1), O(logn), O(n), O(nlogn), O(n2), ....     


Araay/Array List
add and remove at end - O(1)
add and remove at begning - O(n)
add and remove at middle - O(n)
